* eepy
Make your Minecraft server very eepy!

Every few seconds, it checks if no players are online
and stops the server using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SIGSTOP][SIGSTOP]] if that's the case.

This mod is for Minecraft 1.20.1

** Build
Make sure you have Java 17 installed, then run
#+begin_src sh
  ./gradlew build
#+end_src
The jar will be created in =build/libs=.

Or simply download the mod from the [[https://github.com/42LoCo42/minecraft-eepy/releases/latest][latest release]]!

** Install
Add the mod *on the server side*. It is not required on the client.

Then, set up a port knocking daemon like [[https://github.com/jvinet/knock/][this one]] (with example [[file:knockd.ini][config]])
to resume the server if someone wants to connect.
#+begin_src sh
  # Replace eth0 with your external network interface!
  # If your server is reachable from multiple interfaces,
  # run multiple instances of knockd.
  sudo knockd -c knockd.ini -i eth0
#+end_src

** Config
This mod uses the config file =eepy-common.toml=
containing the following fields & defaults:
#+begin_src toml
  # Number of seconds to delay between checks
  # Range: 1 ~ 9223372036854775807
  delaySeconds = 60

  # If a check happens less than X seconds after a player login attempt, it's skipped
  # Range: 1 ~ 9223372036854775807
  afterLoginSeconds = 60

  # If a check happens more than X seconds after its scheduled time, it's skipped
  # Range: 1 ~ 9223372036854775807
  afterDeadlineSeconds = 1
#+end_src
The file will be automatically generated when the mod loads
and can be changed without needing to restart the server.
